## Product Description and Vision

Schedules do not always align within the same household, which can make it difficult to keep track of who does which tasks -- if they are completed at all. This app is targeted toward young professionals, students, and those in shared-living situations, who need easy-to-use and organized-task software to avoid disorganized and messy homes. Homemate is an organizational software product that allows users to create households, chore charts, shared grocery lists, and more. These features will help users keep track of the household chores that they did and when the last time it was completed. Therefore, those within the household can distribute tasks fairly and efficiently. Unlike Sweepy (one of our primary competitors), we will allow for a larger user base and grant all users access to all our product features as well as provide other useful tools besides just a home cleaning schedule. A new feature that we believe would be unique and make us a valid competitor amongst “roommate chore” applications is push notifications of which three tasks should be given top priority for the day or week depending on the user’s inputted schedule. As this feature may exist in some form throughout other applications, access would require a premium subscription to the application.
